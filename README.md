üìå **Detailed Project Write-Up**

_**Project Title:**_ Insurance Risk & Claims Analysis

_**Tools Used:**_ Power BI, Excel, DAX, Data Modeling, Data Cleaning

_1. Business Objective_

The insurance company wanted to analyze its policyholder base and claims behavior to:

Identify high-risk customer segments.

Support risk-based premium pricing.

Improve fraud detection.

Provide management with real-time dashboards for decision-making.

_2. Data Understanding_

Source: Insurance policies dataset (~37.5K records).

Key Attributes: Policyholder demographics (age, gender, marital status, education), car details (make, model year, usage type), coverage zones, claim amounts, and claim frequencies.

Raw Format: Excel file imported into Power BI.

_3. Data Preparation & Modeling_

Cleaned missing values (car year, education levels).

Standardized categorical data (e.g., ‚ÄúMarried/Single/Divorced‚Äù).

Built a Star Schema:

Fact Table: Claims (amount, frequency, date).

Dimension Tables: Customers, Vehicles, Locations, Policies.

Created DAX Measures:

Total Policies

Total Claim Amount

Claim Frequency

Avg Claim Amount

Risk Segmentation

_4. Dashboard Development (Power BI)_

KPIs and Visuals:

Total Policies: 37,542

Total Claim Amount: $187.8M

Average Claim Amount: $5K

Claim Frequency: 0.5

Key Dashboards:

Claims by Car Use: Private ($150M) vs Commercial ($37M).

Claims by Car Make: Ford ($16.6M) highest, followed by Chevrolet ($14.8M).

Claims by Age Group: 26‚Äì65 years had the highest claim amounts (~$35M each).

Claims by Education & Marital Status: Singles with lower education levels filed more claims.

Coverage Zone: Urban & Suburban zones dominated (~40% of total claims).

Car Year Trend: Higher claim amounts for newer cars (2010 onwards).

_5. Key Insights_

Private car users contribute ~80% of claim amounts ‚Üí higher accident exposure.

Middle-aged policyholders (26‚Äì65) are the highest claim contributors.

Singles with lower education levels are more likely to file higher claims.

Newer cars (post-2010) lead to higher claim amounts (costlier repairs/replacements).

Urban & Suburban drivers show the highest claims due to dense traffic conditions.

_6. Business Impact_

Helped underwriting teams adjust premiums for high-risk segments.

Supported fraud detection by identifying unusual claim patterns.

Enabled risk-based pricing models to balance profitability and competitiveness.

Delivered interactive dashboards for real-time decision-making by stakeholders.

_Conclusion:_
